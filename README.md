# Research Notes and Preprints by Han Shen

> _A repository for storing and developing independent research topics across stochastic systems, financial mathematics, and geometric control._

## 🌐 Overview

This GitHub repository serves as a central hub for my preliminary research notes, theoretical frameworks, and future arXiv preprints. The goal is to accumulate and refine a body of work leading toward academic publication and graduate-level research in applied mathematics, particularly in:

- **Stochastic Analysis & SPDEs**
- **Geometric Control Theory**
- **Systemic Risk and Financial Modeling**
- **Game Theory and Mean-Field Systems**
- **Quantitative Derivative Design & Risk Dynamics**

All works here are independently developed, documented in LaTeX, and openly shared under permissive licenses. Most documents are preliminary and may evolve into formal submissions (arXiv, journal publications) after further development.

## 📘 Highlighted Project: Geometric Regulation of Coupled SPDE Systems

📂 coupled-spde-geometry/
A theoretical framework exploring **how to stabilize large-scale coupled stochastic PDE systems** via **geometric constraints on underlying manifolds**, inspired by systemic financial risk dynamics. Core ideas include:

- Modeling submarkets as SPDEs on curved domains
- Regulatory geometry via curvature, boundaries, spectral constraints
- Preventing blow-up and designing systemic feedback control

> 📝 Status: Preliminary theoretical sketch (v0.1), to be extended into an arXiv submission.

## 🔭 Future Directions

- Add numerical simulations using Python + FEniCS/FiPy
- Extend current models to include learning dynamics (e.g., Bayesian inference on manifolds)
- Submit 2–3 selected topics to arXiv after graduate enrollment
